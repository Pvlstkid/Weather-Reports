# Weather-Reports
Hello, im Paul and im new to GitHub, this is my first project in here.
A daily summary about a city for a specific day.
This is a program that makes a json request and read a json response from wunderground.com
Proccesing the json response in order to get the values we are interested in and creating a txt file with a daily summary about NY city for a specific day
My plan is to get an input from a user about a random city and a date  and return a txt file with the daily summary report.
Im using NIO to create/manipulate path,directories and files.
HttpRequest to get the json data from the wunderground.com with an api key.
